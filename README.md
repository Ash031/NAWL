### V 1.0.0

* New project!

## Tutorial

Create a text file with the content you want to use as the wiki with the following rules:

* h1/2/3/4/5/6_ 			Creates a heading line, the lower the number, the higher the font/importance!

* UL_:		Creates an unordered list

* Table:_	Starts a table

* Item 1||Item 2||Item 3||Item 4 	Table's Row (The first one in the table will automatically transform into header)

* _END 		Ends the current Table/List

After doing it run the compiled file with the output as being your text file and it will automatically pop out a formatted wiki text, to use it go to the wiki page and copy paste the cody into the "source code" part of the editing.

## Example

There is an example in this rep, the file "Test.txt" is the input and the file "output.txt" is the output.
